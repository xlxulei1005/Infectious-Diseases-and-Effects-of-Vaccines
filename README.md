### Background
Vaccinations greatly reduced the prevalence of infectious diseases and the low price of vaccines continues to improve the health of millions around the world. To see how we are benefiting from vaccinations it is necessary to compare the suffering before and after the introduction of the vaccine. In this project, we acquired data on 50 infectious diseases in America, calculated the density of infected population in each state every year over a span of roughly 10 decades. Using this data, we provide you with two ways of visualizing the before-after comparison: heat map and geo-heatmap.

Heat map is a chart-like figure that provides an overview of the prevalence of each infectious disease over the years. On the x-axis we have year and on the y-axis we have different states. Each grid is colored corresponding to the proportion of infected individuals in the state population in that given year. The intensity of the color represents the fraction of population infected, the more intense the color the higher number of people infected. There is also a salient vertical black line plotted in each heatmap representing the year of vaccine introduction. The idea is that through comparing the two parts of the heat map separated by the black line, you should be able to clearly visualize a decline in that disease. 

A geo heat map is a visualization of the prevalence of a particular infectious disease in each state directly through the map of the United States. In this program, you can generate a geo heat map by choosing a disease, an year and even a color you like. The resulting graph is a map with each state colored according to the infected rate of that disease. Once again, a more intense color represents a higher infection rate. You will be able to see a difference in the geo maps generated from years before and years after the introduction of vaccine.

### Required packages
Requires Python 3, and the following packages to function successfully:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Basemap

Note on installing Basemap: 
Basemap can be installed easily in command line by simply executing
```
$ conda install basemap
```

Note on installing Seaborn: 
Seaborn can be installed easily in command line by simply executing
```
$ conda install seaborn
```
It's also possible to install the latest released version of seaborn by using pip
```
$ pip install seaborn
```

### Using html5 to visualize the results produced by this program

In the folder "html visualization", you can find the htm file "visualization". Please right click and open it with your preferred web browser. This file allows you to interactively visualize the results produced by this program. 

### Sample walk-through of the main interface
Execute in command line:
```
$ python vaccines_interface.py
```
```
You can type 'Quit' to exit the certain plot type. For example, if you are in heatmap plotting mode, by input 'quit' you can exit the heatmap mode and back to choosing plot type again
You can type 'Exit' to end the program

Please choose one of the following kind of plot:
 Heatmap or Geo-heatmap
 
> Heatmap

-Available diseases are Measles, Hepatitis_A, Rubella, Poliomyelitis, Smallpox and Mumps.
Please enter the name of disease:

> Measles

Mean number of infected people before vaccine invented is:  313904.8
Mean number of infected people after vaccine invented is:  44216.0
```
Upon entering Measles as your chosen disease, the program will generate and store a pdf file that contains the heatmap visualization of the data of measles form 1928 to 1998. The program also prints out the mean number of infected people before and after vaccine introduction. 

```
-Available diseases are Measles, Hepatitis_A, Rubella, Poliomyelitis, Smallpox and Mumps.
Please enter the name of disease: 

 > quit
 
Please choose one of the following kind of plot:
Heatmap or Geo-heatmap

> Geo-heatmap

-Enter the disease name to see the geo-heatmap of disease and vaccines.
-There are more than fifty diseases offered.

Please enter the color of heatmap, the color should be a float number from 0 to 1:

> 0.5

Please enter the disease you want to see, for example: MUMPS,MEASLES or input 'help' to see full list of available diseases

>MUMPS

The year range for this disease is from 1968 to 2014
Please enter the year

> 1970
```
In geo heatmap mode, the user is prompted to enter a disease, a color, and a year. For the program to run successfully, please make sure you enter: 1. a valid disease name from the provided list, which you can obtain by inputting 'help' in the command line to see a full list of available diseases; 2. a valid floating number between 0 to 1 (corresponding to 0-360&deg HSV cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model.) that represents the color you wish the map to have; 3. a valid year from the range provided by the program.
The program should then produce and save a pdf file that contains a geo-heatmap of the corresponding disease, color and year. Note that this process might take up to 15 seconds.

Unittest is also supported in this program. Simply call in command line:
```
python -m unittesttest.py
```
